## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and understanding employee attrition within the company. The analysis provides insights into why employees leave the organization and aims to address these issues proactively.

### Dataset

- Project Name: Employee Retention
- Dataset Name: HR_1 and HR_2
- Dataset Type: Excel Data
- Dataset Size: 50,000 records each

## Problem Statement

The key areas of analysis include:

- Average Attrition rate for all Departments.
- Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist.
- Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats.
- Average working years for each Department.
- Job Role Vs Work life balance.
- Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Power BI (Bookmarking, DAX, Quick Measures, Modelling, Filters, Tooltips.)
- Statistical analysis to derive insights.
- MySQL (Joins, Group by, Having, Window Functions, View, Aggregate Functions.)
  
## Modelling
Created a Data Model Between HR_1 and HR_2 as one to many relationship.
